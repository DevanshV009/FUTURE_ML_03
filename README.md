Customer Support Chatbot for Ticket Classification:
This project involves building a machine learning-powered chatbot that classifies customer support tickets into predefined categories such as Technical Issue, Billing Problem or General Inquiry. Using 
natural language processing (NLP) and a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model analyzes the content of user-submitted issues and predicts the most likely ticket type. The chatbot features 
an interactive interface built with Gradio and leverages text preprocessing, label encoding, and embedding layers to deliver accurate, real-time classification, improving support efficiency and automation.
